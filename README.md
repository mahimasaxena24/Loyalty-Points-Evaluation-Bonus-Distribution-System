# Loyalty-Points-Evaluation-Bonus-Distribution-System
This project presents a complete analytical workflow to evaluate and optimize player loyalty in a gaming ecosystem. It involves the collection and processing of user gameplay, deposit, and withdrawal data to calculate loyalty points, identify top performers, and allocate bonuses based on strategic metrics.

The process includes:

🔍 Data Cleaning & Processing from CSV logs (gameplay, deposits, withdrawals)

🧮 Loyalty Point Calculation using two distinct formulas (Example 1: games & days-based, Example 2: logarithmic scaling)

📊 Exploratory Analysis on deposits, games played, and user engagement

🏆 Ranking & Leaderboard Generation based on loyalty and activity

💰 Bonus Distribution Strategy for top 50 players from a Rs. 50,000 pool

📈 Visual Insights via bar charts, heatmaps, histograms, and cumulative score graphs

💡 Fairness Evaluation of the scoring system and suggestions for improvements

This solution not only identifies high-value users but also ensures that reward distribution is transparent, data-backed, and performance-oriented.
